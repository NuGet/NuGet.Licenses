You may create a Derivative Work by combining Covered Code with other code not\n             otherwise governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Derivative Work as an\n             integrated product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License\n             are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof, including all Modifications.\n      \n\u003cul style=\"list-style:none\"\u003e\n               \n\u003cli\u003e\n                  \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e 4.1\u003c/var\u003e\n          You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute, publish or Externally Deploy, that in\n             whole or in part contains or is derived from the Covered Code or any part thereof, to be\n             licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License and no\n             other license except as provided in Section 4.2. You also must make Source Code available for\n             the Derivative Work under the same terms as Modifications, described in Sections 2 and 3,\n             above.\n        \u003c/li\u003e\n               \n\u003cli\u003e\n                  \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e 4.2\u003c/var\u003e\n          Compatible Source Licenses. Software modules that have been independently developed without any\n             use of Covered Code and which contain no portion of the Covered Code, Modifications or other\n             Derivative Works, but are used or combined in any way \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e with\u003c/var\u003e the Covered Code or any Derivative\n             Work to form a larger Derivative Work, are exempt from the conditions described in Section 4.1\n             but only to the extent that: the software module, including any software that is linked to,\n             integrated with, or part of the same applications as, the software module by any method must\n             be wholly subject to one of the Compatible Source Licenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all\n             Covered Code must be subject to the terms of this License. Thus, the entire Derivative Work\n             must be licensed under a combination of the RPSL (for Covered Code) and a Compatible Source\n             License for any independently developed software modules within the Derivative Work. The\n             foregoing requirement applies even if the Compatible Source License would ordinarily allow the\n             software module to link with, or form larger works with, other software that is not subject to\n             the Compatible Source License. For example, although the Mozilla Public License v1.1 allows\n             Mozilla code to be combined with proprietary software that is not subject to the MPL, if\n             MPL-licensed code is used with Covered Code the MPL-licensed code could not be combined or\n             linked with any code not governed by the MPL. The general intent of this section 4.2 is to\n             enable use of Covered Code with applications that are wholly subject to an acceptable open\n             source license.
