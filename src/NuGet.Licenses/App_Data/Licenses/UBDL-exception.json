It achieves this guarantee by imposing obligations on anyone\n          who chooses to distribute the software.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          Some of these obligations may be seen as unnecessarily burdensome.  In\n          particular, when the source code for the software is already publicly\n          and freely available, there is minimal value in imposing upon each\n          distributor the obligation to provide the complete source code (or an\n          equivalent written offer to provide the complete source code).\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          This Licence allows for the distribution of unmodified binaries built\n          from publicly available source code, without imposing the obligations\n          of the GNU General Public License upon anyone who chooses to\n          distribute only the unmodified binaries built from that source code.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          The extra permissions granted by this Licence apply only to unmodified\n          binaries built from source code which has already been made available\n          to the public in accordance with the terms of the GNU General Public\n          Licence.
