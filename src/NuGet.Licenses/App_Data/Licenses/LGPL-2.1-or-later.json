By contrast, the GNU General Public\n      Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n      free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n      specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n      Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You\n      can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n      this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n      strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not\n      price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n      have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n      this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if\n      you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new\n      free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n      distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender\n      these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities\n      for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n      or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we\n      gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n      source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n      complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n      with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n      it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright\n      the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you\n      legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there\n      is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified\n      by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they\n      have is not the original version, so that the original author\u0026apos;s reputation\n      will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence\n      of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n      effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n      restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that\n      any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n      consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by\n      the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU\n      Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated\n      libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General\n      Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in\n      order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n      a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n      combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary\n      General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire\n      combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public\n      License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      We call this license the \u0026quot;Lesser\u0026quot; General Public License\n      because it does Less to protect the user\u0026apos;s freedom than the\n      ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free\n      software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free\n      programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary\n      General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser\n      license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n      encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that\n      it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs\n      must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a\n      free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\n      In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library\n      to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n      programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free\n      software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free\n      programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating\n      system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of\n      the users\u0026apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that\n      is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal\n      to run that program using a modified version of the Library.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n      modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between\n      a \u0026quot;work based on the library\u0026quot; and a \u0026quot;work that uses the library\u0026quot;.\n      The former contains code derived from the library, whereas\n      the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul style=\"list-style:none\"\u003e\n      \n\u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e 0.\u003c/var\u003e\n        This License Agreement applies to any software library or\n        other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright\n        holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed\n        under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also\n        called \u0026quot;this License\u0026quot;).

A \u0026quot;work based on\n          the Library\u0026quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under\n          copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n          portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n          straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation\n          is included without limitation in the term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.)\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          \u0026quot;Source code\u0026quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work\n          for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source\n          code means all the source code for all modules it contains,\n          plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts\n          used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are\n          not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\n          running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output\n          from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a\n          work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library\n          in a tool for writing it).

Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n          application-supplied function or table used by this function\n          must be optional: if the application does not supply it,\n          the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.

But when you distribute the same sections as part of a\n          whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution\n          of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose\n          permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,\n          and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or\n          contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,\n          the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution\n          of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on\n          the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the\n          Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does\n          not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n      \n\u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e 3.\u003c/var\u003e\n        You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General\n        Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the\n        Library.
