While this license is intended to facilitate\n                 the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a\n                 commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\n                 liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in\n                 a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\u0026quot;Commercial Contributor\u0026quot;)\n                 hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\u0026quot;Indemnified\n                 Contributor\u0026quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively\n                 \u0026quot;Losses\u0026quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a\n                 third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or\n                 omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the\n                 Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply\n                 to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\n                 infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify\n                 the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial\n                 Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense\n                 and any related settlement negotiations.

Under this section,\n             the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related\n             to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\n             pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \u003c/li\u003e\n        \n\u003cli\u003e\n            \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e 5.\u003c/var\u003e\n          NO WARRANTY\n            \u003cbr /\u003e\n\n   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \u0026quot;AS\n                 IS\u0026quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n                 IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\n                 NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
