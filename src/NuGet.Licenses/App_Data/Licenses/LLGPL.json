Nevertheless, \u003cvar class=\"optional-license-text\"\u003e the\u003c/var\u003e LGPL can still be applied to\n            a Lisp program if certain clarifications are made. This document\n            details those clarifications. Accordingly, the license for\n            \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e the\n            open-source Lisp applications\u003c/var\u003e consists of this document plus\n\t    \u003cvar class=\"optional-license-text\"\u003e the\u003c/var\u003e LGPL. Wherever there is a conflict between this document\n\t    and the LGPL, this document takes precedence over \u003cvar class=\"optional-license-text\"\u003e the\u003c/var\u003e LGPL.\n         \u003c/p\u003e\n\n         \u003cp\u003e\n            A \u0026quot;Library\u0026quot; in Lisp is a collection of Lisp functions, data and\n            foreign modules. The form of the Library can be Lisp source code\n            (for processing by an interpreter) or object code (usually the\n            result of compilation of source code or built with some other\n            mechanisms). Foreign modules are object code in a form that can\n            be linked into a Lisp executable. When we speak of functions we\n            do so in the most general way to include, in addition, methods\n            and unnamed functions. Lisp \u0026quot;data\u0026quot; is also a general term that\n            includes the data structures resulting from defining Lisp classes.\n            A Lisp application may include the same set of Lisp objects\n            as does a Library, but this does not mean that the application\n            is necessarily a \u0026quot;work based on the Library\u0026quot; it contains.\n         \u003c/p\u003e\n\n         \u003cp\u003e\n            The \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e \n            consists of everything in the distribution file set\n            before any modifications are made to the files. If any of the\n            functions or classes in the \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e \n            are redefined in other files,\n            then those redefinitions ARE considered a work based on the\n            \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e. \n            If additional methods are added to generic functions in\n            the \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e, \n            those additional methods are NOT considered a work\n            based on the \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e. \n            If \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e classes are subclassed, these\n            subclasses are NOT considered a work based on the \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e. \n            If the Library is modified to explicitly call other functions that are\n            neither part of Lisp itself nor an available add-on module to Lisp,\n            then the functions called by the modified \n            \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e \n            ARE considered a work based on the \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e. \n            The goal is to ensure that the \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e\n            will compile and run without getting undefined function errors.\n         \u003c/p\u003e\n\n         \u003cp\u003e\n            It is permitted to add proprietary source code to the \n            \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e,\n            but it must be done in a way such that the \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e \n            will still run without that proprietary code present. Section 5 of the LGPL\n            distinguishes between the case of a library being dynamically linked\n            at runtime and one being statically linked at build time. Section\n            5 of the LGPL states that the former results in an executable\n            that is a \u0026quot;work that uses the Library.\u0026quot; Section 5 of the LGPL\n            states that the latter results in one that is a \u0026quot;derivative of the\n\t    Library\u0026quot;, which is therefore covered by \u003cvar class=\"optional-license-text\"\u003e the\u003c/var\u003e LGPL. Since Lisp only\n            offers one choice, which is to link the Library into an executable\n            at build time, we declare that, for the purpose applying the LGPL\n            to the \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e, \n            an executable that results from linking a \u0026quot;work\n            that uses the \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e\u0026quot; \n            with the Library is considered a \u0026quot;work\n            that uses the Library\u0026quot; and is therefore NOT covered by the LGPL.\n         \u003c/p\u003e\n\n         \u003cp\u003e\n            Because of this declaration, section 6 of LGPL is not applicable\n            to the \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e. \n            However, in connection with each distribution of\n            this executable, you must also deliver, in accordance with the\n            terms and conditions of the LGPL, the source code of \n            \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e Library\u003c/var\u003e (or\n            your derivative thereof) that is incorporated into this executable.\n         \u003c/p\u003e\n\n      ",
