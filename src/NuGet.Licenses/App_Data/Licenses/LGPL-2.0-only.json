By contrast, the GNU General Public\n      Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n      free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      This license, the Library General Public License, applies\n      to some specially designated Free Software Foundation\n      software, and to any other libraries whose authors\n      decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\n      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have\n      the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n      this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get\n      it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n      it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n      anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the\n      rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n      you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n      or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we\n      gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n      source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide\n      complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\n      with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\n      it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\n      the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you\n      legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Also, for each distributor\u0026apos;s protection, we want to make certain\n      that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this\n      free library. If the library is modified by someone else and\n      passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have\n      is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by\n      others will not reflect on the original authors\u0026apos; reputations.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n      patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing\n      free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus\n      in effect transforming the program into proprietary software.\n      To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\n      be licensed for everyone\u0026apos;s free use or not licensed at all.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n      ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility\n      programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License,\n      applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite\n      different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don\u0026apos;t\n      assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is\n      that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying\n      or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with\n      a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply\n      using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program\n      or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the\n      linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original\n      library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\n      Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\n      sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We\n      concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\n      users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\n      libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended\n      to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\n      preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\n      libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to\n      achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved\n      it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The\n      hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution\n      and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference\n      between a \u0026quot;work based on the library\u0026quot; and a \u0026quot;work that uses\n      the library\u0026quot;. The former contains code derived from the\n      library, while the latter only works together with the library.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the\n      ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003e\n      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n    \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul style=\"list-style:none\"\u003e\n      \n\u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e 0.\u003c/var\u003e\n        This License Agreement applies to any software library\n        which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\n        other authorized party saying it may be distributed under\n        the terms of this Library General Public License (also\n        called \u0026quot;this License\u0026quot;).

A \u0026quot;work based on\n          the Library\u0026quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under\n          copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n          portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n          straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation\n          is included without limitation in the term \u0026quot;modification\u0026quot;.)\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          \u0026quot;Source code\u0026quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work\n          for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source\n          code means all the source code for all modules it contains,\n          plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts\n          used to control compilation and installation of the library.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are\n          not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\n          running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output\n          from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a\n          work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library\n          in a tool for writing it).

Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n              application-supplied function or table used by this function\n              must be optional: if the application does not supply it,\n              the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n            \u003c/p\u003e\n\n          \u003c/li\u003e\n        \n\u003c/ul\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.

But when you distribute the same sections as part of a\n          whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution\n          of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose\n          permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,\n          and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or\n          contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,\n          the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution\n          of derivative or collective works based on the Library.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \u003cp\u003e\n          In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on\n          the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the\n          Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does\n          not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n        \u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003c/li\u003e\n      \n\u003cli\u003e\n        \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e 3.\u003c/var\u003e\n        You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General\n        Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the\n        Library.
