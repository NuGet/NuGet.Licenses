If the licensor\u0026apos;s\n         permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or\n         limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only\n         permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n         the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have\n         copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that\n         all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n         respect those requests where reasonable. \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e More considerations\u003c/var\u003e for the public\u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e : wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees\u003c/var\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n\n      \u003cdiv class=\"optional-license-text\"\u003e \n         \u003cp\u003eCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003eBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and\n         conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (\u0026quot;Public License\u0026quot;).\n         To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed\n         Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You\n         such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material\n         available under these terms and conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003cp\u003eSection 1 \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e \u003c/var\u003e Definitions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul style=\"list-style:none\"\u003e\n          \n\u003cli\u003e\n            \u003cvar class=\"replaceable-license-text\"\u003e a.\u003c/var\u003e\n            Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from\n               or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated,\n               altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission\n               under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.
