Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its\n         copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above\n         copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation;\n         principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for\n         full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG\n         code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003cp\u003eThe Unix configuration script \u0026quot;configure\u0026quot; was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by\n         the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts\n         (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by\n         M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003cp\u003eIt appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM,\n         AT\u0026amp;T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more\n         licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.\n         (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is\n         unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent\n         restrictions on the remaining code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003cp\u003eThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the\n         Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been\n         simplified to produce \u0026quot;uncompressed GIFs\u0026quot;. This technique does not use the LZW algorithm;\n         the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n      \u003cp\u003eWe are required to state that\n        \u003cbr /\u003e\n\n\u0026quot;The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.\n             GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated.\u0026quot;\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n\n    ",
